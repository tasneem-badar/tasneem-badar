### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am an aspiring data analyst driven by a relentless curiosity to uncover hidden insights within complex datasets. I have hands-on experience building supervised and unsupervised machine learning models; my practical expertise includes developing models for classification, regression and clustering, allowing me to derive actionable insights and drive informed decision-making. Additionally, I possess proficiency in working with relational databases such as SQLite and non-relational databases like PyMongo.
