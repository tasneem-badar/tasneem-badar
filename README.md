### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am an aspiring data analyst driven by a relentless curiosity to uncover hidden insights within complex datasets. I have hands-on experience building supervised and unsupervised machine learning models; my practical expertise includes developing models for classification, regression and clustering, allowing me to derive actionable insights and drive informed decision-making. 

I build data science projects as a part of my academic work, and I am passionate about learning new techniques and incorporating them into my work. I have dedicated much of my time to exploring this vast field of data science, and I am on a path towards becoming a data scientist.
